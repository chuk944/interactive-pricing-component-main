### What I learned

This Project allowed me to use and re-enforce my CSS skills. I used Position Absolute and Position Relative several times to meet the requirements of the design. I also used Input Range and custom Slider and Thumb in CSS for the first time. Great learning experience.


### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on my JavaScript skills. I would like to work with CSS Variables and controlling them with JavaScript. This project was very good for that. Looking forward to more projects like this one
